# Project Write-Up #2: Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

The objective of this lab was to capture and analyze various types of network traffic including:
- DNS lookups
- HTTP requests
- TCP three-way handshake

The student used Wireshark filters and protocol inspection techniques to identify unusual traffic patterns, simulate brute-force behavior, and extract credentials from captured packets.
