# Project Write-Up #3: Advanced CTF Challenges in Kali Linux

This lab involved solving a series of Capture The Flag (CTF) tasks using:
- Nmap scanning
- Exploitation frameworks (e.g. Metasploit)
- Privilege escalation vectors

The student documented each flag discovered, attack path, and mitigation strategy in a structured pentest-style report.
