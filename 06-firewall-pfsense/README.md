# Project Write-Up #6: Enterprise Firewall Implementation with pfSense

**Date:**  
May 2025

**Objective:**  
Design and deploy a secure network using pfSense as a perimeter firewall and internal segmentation system, including VPN access, VLAN separation, and IDS integration.

**Environment Used:**  
- pfSense VM (2 NICs)  
- VirtualBox or Proxmox  
- Client/Server nodes  
- OpenVPN, Snort, DHCP, DNS

**Activities:**  
- pfSense installation and setup  
- Configuration of firewall rules, NAT, VLANs  
- Setup of VPN tunnel and Snort IDS  
- Validation through simulated traffic

**Results Achieved:**  
- Functional segmented network with secure remote access  
- Real-time intrusion detection  
- Hardened gateway firewall

**Skills Gained:**  
- pfSense administration  
- Network perimeter defense  
- IDS tuning and secure VPN
