# Project Write-Up #4: MikroTik + GNS3 Network Simulation

In this lab, the student deployed a virtual MikroTik CHR router in GNS3 and configured:
- IP routing and DHCP
- Firewall rules and NAT
- Static routes and VLANs

The simulation reproduced an enterprise-grade topology and tested inter-VLAN routing and perimeter security controls.
